# AGENTS.md

Instructions for AI agents working in this codebase.

## Branch and PR Workflow

- Use staging as the integration branch for feature work.

- Create feature branches from the latest staging, preferably in isolated worktrees under `.worktrees/<branch-name>`
- Open small, focused PRs from each feature branch into staging.
- Do not merge unrelated feature work into another feature branch unless the PR is intentionally stacked and the dependency is real.
- Keep PRs reviewable for code review agents: split by feature, ownership boundary, or behavioral surface rather than accumulating a large mixed diff.
- After a feature PR merges into staging, update any active feature branches from staging before continuing work.
- Promote staging to main only when the integrated set of changes is ready for release.

## Using Vite+, the Unified Toolchain for the Web

This project is using Vite+, a unified toolchain built on top of Vite, Rolldown, Vitest, tsdown, Oxlint, Oxfmt, and Vite Task. Vite+ wraps runtime management, package management, and frontend tooling in a single global CLI called `vp`. Vite+ is distinct from Vite, and it invokes Vite through `vp dev` and `vp build`. Run `vp help` to print a list of commands and `vp <command> --help` for information about a specific command.

Docs are local at `node_modules/vite-plus/docs` or online at https://viteplus.dev/guide/.

### Review Checklist

- [ ] Run `vp install` after pulling remote changes and before getting started.
- [ ] Run `vp check` and `vp test` to format, lint, type check and test changes.
- [ ] Check if there are `vite.config.ts` tasks or `package.json` scripts necessary for validation, run via `vp run <script>`.
- [ ] If setup, runtime, or package-manager behavior looks wrong, run `vp env doctor` and include its output when asking for help.

## Using Convex

This project uses [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend.

When working on Convex code, **always read
`src/convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md` first** for important guidelines on
how to correctly use Convex APIs and patterns. The file contains rules that
override what you may have learned about Convex from training data.

Convex agent skills for common tasks can be installed by running
`npx convex ai-files install`.

## Source Code Reference

Source code for dependencies is cached at `~/.opensrc/`.

Use `opensrc path` inside other commands to read source:

\`\`\`bash
rg "pattern" $(opensrc path <package>)
cat $(opensrc path <package>)/path/to/file
\`\`\`
